      question: "Difference between authorization and authentication ?",
      answer:
        "Authentication means to confirm your own identity, while authorization means to grant access to the system. In simple terms, authentication verifies who you are, while authorization verifies what you have access to. 1/Authentication for User identity is confirmed . 2/ Authentication User and user server is verified 3/ Authentication Login details, usernames, passwords, OTPs required . And 1/ Authorization Here, the user is given permission to access the system . 2/ Authorization Here it is validated if the user is allowed to access via some defined rules. 3/ Authorization Checks the security level and privilege of the user, thus determining what the user can or cannot have access to etc",
